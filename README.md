# Starter code for Faucet dApp tutorial

Boilerplate code consisting of a new create-react-app project and some basic HTML and CSS.
This is a simple React application that interacts with MetaMask, a popular Ethereum wallet. The application displays a web page with a navigation bar and a section for a faucet (to receive tokens). The user can connect their MetaMask wallet to the app, and upon successful connection, the wallet address is displayed in the navigation bar.

Here's a brief explanation of the components in the code:

1. Import Statements: The code starts with importing the necessary modules and stylesheets required for the React application.

2. `App` Component: This is the main component of the React application. It uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks provided by React to manage the state of the `walletAddress` and to perform side effects like fetching data when the component mounts or when the `walletAddress` changes.

3. `walletAddress` State: The `walletAddress` state variable is used to store the user's Ethereum wallet address. It's initialized as an empty string.

4. `useEffect`: The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `getCurrentWalletConnected` function and `addWalletListener` function when the component mounts or when the `walletAddress` changes. This way, it ensures that the user's wallet address is fetched initially and updated whenever the user switches their connected wallet in MetaMask.

5. `connectWallet` Function: This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button. It checks if MetaMask is installed in the user's browser, and if so, requests the user to connect their wallet. If the connection is successful, the user's wallet address is stored in the `walletAddress` state.

6. `getCurrentWalletConnected` Function: This function is called inside `useEffect` and is used to fetch the user's current wallet address from MetaMask when the application is loaded or re-rendered.

7. `addWalletListener` Function: This function adds an event listener to MetaMask to listen for changes in the connected wallet. If the user switches their connected wallet in MetaMask, the `setWalletAddress` function is called to update the `walletAddress` state with the new wallet address.

8. JSX (User Interface): The `return` statement contains the JSX that defines the user interface of the application. It includes a navigation bar with a "Connect Wallet" button and a section for the faucet. The user's wallet address is displayed in the button if the wallet is connected.

9. Faucet Section: The faucet section contains an input field for the user to enter their wallet address and a "GET TOKENS" button. The functionality for the "GET TOKENS" button is not implemented in the provided code.

Overall, this application serves as a simple front-end that connects to the user's MetaMask wallet and displays the wallet address. It can be extended to include further functionality like interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions, or accessing token balances using the user's wallet address. The README file for this application would typically contain information about how to set up and run the application, dependencies required, and other relevant details for users and developers.
